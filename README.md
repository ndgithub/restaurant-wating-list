# Restaurant Waiting List
A simple game made with HTML/CSS, Javascript/jQuery, Handlebars and MySQL. Add customers to the waiting list, keep track of how long they have been waiting, seat them, then check them out. 

## Things I learned
* Setting up and using a MySQL database
* Server-side rendering with handlebars
* Deploying to Heroku and using JAWS DB.
